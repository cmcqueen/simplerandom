Simple pseudo-random number generators for C, Python, Rust.

Intro
-----

This project provides `simplerandom`, simple pseudo-random number
generators.

Features:

* Main API functions:
    * Seed
    * Generate "next" random value
    * "Discard" also known as "jumpahead" to skip the generator
      ahead by 'n' samples.
    * Mix real random data into the generator state
* Simple algorithms that are easily ported to different languages.
* Safe seeding. Many generators have some "bad" state values that must
  be avoided. The seed functions for all generators ensure that any
  "bad" state values are avoided, and replaced by a suitable
  alternative initial state.
* These random number generators have been implemented in the following
  languages:
    * C
    * Python
    * Rust
* Same numeric output in each supported language. It can be useful
  to be able to implement the identical algorithm on muliple
  platforms and/or languages.
* Simple algorithms and state size appropriate for limited RAM and ROM
  (e.g. in embedded systems).
* Decent cross-platform support.
    * Various OS.
    * Various processors, 8- to 64-bit.
* Implement target language's API idioms and/or existing random number
  generator API.
* Reasonable statistical properties of pseudo-random output (though
  not for all generators provided).

Algorithms
----------

Most algorithms were obtained from two newsgroup posts by George
Marsaglia [[mars1]](#mars1) [[mars2]](#mars2). However, some
modifications have been made. From [[rose1]](#rose1), it seems that the
SHR3 algorithm defined in [[mars1]](#mars1) is flawed and should not be
used. It doesn't actually have a period of 2<sup>32</sup>-1 as expected, but has
64 different cycles, some with very short periods. The SHR3 in the 2003
post is very similar, but with two shift values swapped. It has a
period of 2<sup>32</sup>-1 as expected.

We still find KISS from [[mars1]](#mars1) useful mainly because it uses
32-bit calculations for MWC, which can be more suitable for small
embedded systems. So we define KISS that uses a MWC based on
[[mars1]](#mars1), but the Cong and SHR3 from [[mars2]](#mars2).

From Pierre L'Ecuyer [[lecuyer1]](#lecuyer1) [[lecuyer2]](#lecuyer2),
the Combined LFSR (Tausworthe) LFSR113 algorithm
[[lecuyer3]](#lecuyer3) and LFSR88 (aka Taus88) have been implemented.

### Random Number Generators Provided

The following pseudo-random number generators are provided:

| Generator   | Notes
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `MWC1`      | Two 32-bit MWCs combined. From [[mars1]](#mars1).
| `MWC2`      | Very similar to `MWC1`, but slightly modified to improve its statistical properties.
| `Cong`      | From [[mars2]](#mars2).
| `SHR3`      | From [[mars2]](#mars2).
| `MWC64`     | A single 64-bit multiply-with-carry calculation. From [[mars2]](#mars2).
| `KISS`      | Combination of MWC2, Cong and SHR3. Based on [[mars1]](#mars1) but using Cong and SHR3 from [[mars2]](#mars2), and the modified MWC.
| `KISS2`     | Combination of MWC64, Cong and SHR3. From [[mars2]](#mars2).
| `LFSR113`   | Combined LFSR (Tausworthe) random number generator by L'Ecuyer. From [[lecuyer1]](#lecuyer1) [[lecuyer3]](#lecuyer3).
| `LFSR88`    | Combined LFSR (Tausworthe) random number generator by L'Ecuyer. From [[lecuyer2]](#lecuyer2).


C
-

A C implementation of simplerandom is provided. It should compile on a
wide range of platforms and OS.

### stdint.h

Note that simplerandom uses `stdint.h` for integer types such as
`uint32_t`, so that must be available. The generator `MWC64`, and
`KISS2` which uses it, use 64-bit calculations with `uint64_t`. For
platforms which do not support 64-bit integers, these generators are
not included in the build. This is done via checking for the macro
define `UINT64_C`.

Note that C++ compilers may not define the constant macros `UINT32_C`
and `UINT64_C` unless the following line is used before the `stdint.h`
include:

    #define __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS

### Build and Install for Unix

For Unix-style platforms the library can be built via autotools in the
normal method. E.g.:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

To run very basic unit tests:

    make check

Optional cxxtest unit tests are provided. To run these:

    ./configure --with-cxxteset
    make check

### Build and Install for Other Platforms

For other platforms, it should not be difficult to add the source files
to a project.

### Include File

Include file:

    #include <simplerandom.h>

A C++ simplerandom library is planned in future. C++ code should be
able to use the C library, but should use a different include to use
the C library instead of a C++ library:

    #include <simplerandom-c.h>

### Usage

#### Generator State Variable

First define a variable to contain the simplerandom generator state.
E.g.:

    static SimpleRandomCong_t rng_cong;
    static SimpleRandomKISS_t rng_kiss;

By encapsulating generator state in a variable, multiple independent
generators can be used at the same time. Independent output can be
achieved by seeding them with different seeds, or by calling the
generator's `discard` function to "jump-ahead" by a certain number of
samples.

#### Seeding

Seed the generator once with a suitable number of `uint32_t` seed
values. The number of seeds depends on the generator.

    simplerandom_cong_seed(&rng_cong, 2051391225u);
    simplerandom_kiss_seed(&rng_kiss, 2247183469u, 99545079u, 3269400377u, 3950144837u);

Alternatively, there are seed functions which take seed data from an
array of `uint32_t`.

    uint32_t seed_array[8] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };
    simplerandom_kiss_seed_array(&rng_kiss, seed_array, 8, false);

If the last parameter `mix_extras` is `false`, then any "extra"
seed values are simply ignored. So the above is equivalent to:

    simplerandom_kiss_seed(&rng_kiss, 1, 2, 3, 4);

If the last parameter `mix_extras` is `true`, then any "extra"
seed values are mixed into the state in the same was as is done by the
`mix` function (see below). So:

    uint32_t seed_array[8] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };
    simplerandom_kiss_seed_array(&rng_kiss, seed_array, 8, true);

is equivalent to:

    simplerandom_kiss_seed(&rng_kiss, 1, 2, 3, 4);
    simplerandom_kiss_mix(&rng_kiss, &seed_array[4], 4);

#### Generate Random Values

Call the generator's `next` function multiple times to generate random
values. All generators output uniformly distributed `uint32_t` values
in the full range (except for the SHR3 generator which excludes 0 as an
output value).

    uint32_t rng_value;
    uint32_t rng_values_array[8];
    ...
    rng_value = simplerandom_cong_next(&rng_cong);
    ...
    for (i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {
        rng_values_array[i] = simplerandom_kiss_next(&rng_kiss);
    }

#### Discard (Jumpahead) Function

Each generator has a `discard` function, which is equivalent to the
`jumpahead` function in the Python package. It is named `discard` in
the C library, to be consistent with the naming of the function in the
C++11/Boost random API.

The `discard` function allows for a generator to be moved ahead by _n_
samples.

    simplerandom_kiss_discard(&rng_kiss, 1000000000000uLL);

Note that _n_ is of type `uintmax_t`, which would probably be 64-bit
on most platforms, but might be 32-bit on some small embedded
platforms.

The calculation is done with time complexity O(log n), so _n_ can be
very large and `jumpahead` will still calculate quickly.

#### Mix Function

In some systems, there might be some source of random data available,
although the quality may not be statistically ideal. The simplerandom
library provides `mix` functions, to mix random data in to the
generator state.

Incorporating truly random data decreases the predictability of the
generator's output, which might be useful in some applications. Even if
the statistical properties of the random data isn't that great, once it
is mixed into the generator's state, the generator's output should
still be statistically good.

    uint32_t real_random_data[8];
    ...
    get_real_random_data_from_somewhere(&real_random_data, 8);
    simplerandom_kiss_mix(&rng_kiss, real_random_data, 8);


Python
------

The `simplerandom` package is provided, which contains modules
containing classes for various simple pseudo-random number generators.

One module provides Python iterators, which generate simple unsigned
32-bit integers identical to their C counterparts.

Another module provides random classes that are sub-classed from the
class `Random` in the `random` module of the standard Python library.

### Modules Provided

| Module                     | Description
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------
| `simplerandom.iterators`   | Iterator classes, which generate unsigned 32-bit integers.
| `simplerandom.random`      | Classes that conform to standard Python `random.Random` API.

In `simplerandom.iterators`, the generators are provided as Python
iterators, of infinite length (they never raise `StopIteration`). They
implement the `__next__()` function to generate the next random integer.
All the generators output 32-bit unsigned values, and take one or more
32-bit seed values during initialisation/seeding.

In `simplerandom.random`, pseudo-random number generators are provided
which have the same names as those in `simplerandom.iterators`, but
these generators implement the standard Python `random.Random` API.
The `jumpahead()` function (in the style of the Python 2.x API) is
implemented for all the generators, even though `jumpahead()` has
officially been removed from the Python 3.x random API. Each generator
uses the iterator of the same name in `simplerandom.iterators` to
generate the random bits used to produce the random floats.

### Iterators Usage

    >>> import simplerandom.iterators as sri
    >>> rng = sri.KISS(123958, 34987243, 3495825239, 2398172431)
    >>> next(rng)
    702862187
    >>> next(rng)
    13888114
    >>> next(rng)
    699722976

It is possible to "jump ahead" by _n_ values at any time. The
calculation is done with time complexity O(log n), so _n_ can be very
large and `jumpahead` will still calculate quickly.

    >>> rng.jumpahead(1000000000000000000)
    >>> next(rng)
    709328996L

### Random class API Usage

    >>> import simplerandom.random as srr
    >>> rng = srr.KISS(258725234)
    >>> rng.random()
    0.0925917826051541
    >>> rng.random()
    0.02901686453730415
    >>> rng.random()
    0.9024972981686489

The `jumpahead` function is supported for all generators in both
Python 2.x and 3.x.

    >>> rng.jumpahead(1000000000000000000)
    >>> rng.random()
    0.1423603103150949

### Supported Python Versions

Python 3.6 through 3.9 is supported. It may or may not run on earlier
Python 3.x versions, but these versions are no longer being tested.

### Use of Cython

[Cython](http://cython.org/) is used to make a fast implementation of
`simplerandom.iterators`. Cython creates a `.c` file that can be
compiled into a Python binary extension module.

The `simplerandom` source distribution package includes a `.c` file that
was created with Cython, so it is not necessary to have Cython installed
to install `simplerandom`.

The Cython `.pyx` file is also included, if you want to modify the
Cython source code, in which case you do need to have Cython installed.
But by default, `setup.py` builds the extension from the `.c` file (to
ensure that the build doesn't fail due to particular Cython version
issues). If you wish to build using Cython from the included `.pyx`
file, you must set `USE_CYTHON=True` in `setup.py`.

### Installation

The simplerandom package is installed using `distutils`. If you have the
tools installed to build a Python extension module, run the following
command:

    python setup.py install

If you cannot build the C extension, you may install just the pure
Python implementation, using the following command:

    python setup.py build_py install --skip-build

### Unit Testing

Unit testing of the iterators is in `simplerandom.iterators.test`.
It duplicates the tests of the C algorithms given in the original
newsgroup post [[mars1]](#mars1), as well as other unit tests.

To run unit tests:

    python -m simplerandom.iterators.test

A more thorough unit test suite is needed. A unit test suite for
`simplerandom.random` is needed.
